# OpenArc Entry

Use this as the first stop when the user says "use OpenArc" or asks for repository governance without naming a specific skill.

## Fast Routing

Map the user's request to the narrowest skill:

| User Intent | Use |
| --- | --- |
| "Set up OpenArc here" | `repository-governance`, then profile-specific governance skills as needed |
| "What is missing?" / "Audit this repo" | `repository-governance` in read-only audit mode, then run the scan helper if available |
| "Clarify this request" / "New feature" / "New goal" | `clarification-gate`, then route to PRD, spec, plan, or implementation |
| "Write PRD" | `product-governance` |
| "Write spec" | `spec-workflow` |
| "Plan implementation" | `planning-engine` |
| "Define design system" | `design-governance` |
| "Define brand" | `brand-governance` |
| "Organize assets" | `assets-governance` |
| "Migrate existing workspace" | `workspace-migration` |
| "Version this change" | `version-governance` |
| "Branch, commit, or PR" | `release-workflow`; stop after the requested git/PR work |
| "Release or publish" | `release-workflow`; require an explicit release request and confirmation |
| "Prepare for open source" | `open-source-maintenance` |

## Default First Pass

For a new or unfamiliar repository:

1. Scan existing files before writing.
2. Use the detected `repo_profile` to separate core, delivery, and conditional governance.
3. Report what already exists, what is profile-relevant missing, and what conflicts.
4. Recommend one of:
   - bootstrap missing governance
   - migrate existing docs
   - clarify a new goal or change before writing PRD, spec, or plan
   - create one spec and plan
   - prepare branch/PR/release
5. Ask only for decisions that materially affect output.

## Helper Scripts

If this plugin's `scripts/openarc.py` is available, prefer:

```bash
python3 plugins/openarc/scripts/openarc.py scan .
python3 plugins/openarc/scripts/openarc.py doctor plugins/openarc
```

Use script output as evidence, not as a replacement for judgment.

## Rules

- Do not load every OpenArc skill by default.
- Treat audit, review, scan, and "what is missing?" requests as read-only. Report findings without creating or modifying files.
- Write governance files only when the user explicitly requests setup, initialization, apply, repair, or migration work.
- A branch, commit, or PR request does not authorize a release. Trigger or publish a release only after an explicit release request and confirmation.
- Do not create all governance docs unless the user asks for full setup.
- Use `clarification-gate` before PRD, spec, plan, or implementation work when the request is broad, ambiguous, risky, or new.
- Do not require `docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/BRAND.md`, or `docs/assets/*` for script, CLI, automation, library, or docs-only repositories unless the repo already has UI or brand signals.
- Prefer a small first useful artifact over a complete governance dump.
- Existing repository conventions win over OpenArc templates.
